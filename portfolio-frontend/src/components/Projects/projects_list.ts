      "This project solved the problem of a racecar photographer. After a race day, thousands of photos would need to be sorted manually by hand, visually determining which Racecar belonged to who by identifying the number written on the side of the car. This project reduces the time spent on this process by about 4000%",

    title: "Intelligent Subtitles Extension",
    description:
      "Many movies of today have difficult to understand dialogue, especially in scenes with loud background noise or special effect sounds playing. It is not an ideal experience to rewind a movie and turn on subtitles, and then turn them back off once the scene is over. However, sometimes that's what's required to make sure you don't miss critical information in a film. This extension uses AI to intelligently determine when subtitles should be turned on in a film. This takes the onus off the viewer, allowing them to sit back and relax, knowing they won't miss a beat.",
